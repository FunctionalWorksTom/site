## Screencast: Outside-In Classicist TDD by Sandro Mancuso

In this screencast Sandro Mancuso performs the Mars Rover kata using Classicist TDD but starting from outside, that means, the public interface of the main class (Rover). As in any good classicist approach to TDD, design decisions are done during the refactoring phase. This video shows that the outside-in approach to _design_ is still relevant regardless which TDD style you prefer.
