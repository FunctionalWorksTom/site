This post is a part of the upcoming series on different ways of setting up your Rust development environment. It's time for VSCode.

While on Linux VSCode with the Rust plugin seems to work more or less out of the box, on a Mac I needed to spend some time configuring it.

First things first though, let's start by installing Rust version manager, rustup.

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

We will be using nightly version of rust as to have one version that can compile all of our tools. This is mostly due to [`clippy`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy) requiring a nightly compiler.

```
rustup install nightly
rustup default nightly
```

We will need Rust Language Server to provide the code completion.

```
rustup component add rls-preview --toolchain nightly
rustup component add rust-analysis --toolchain nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
```

For a more wholesome experience, please have some tools as well:

```
cargo install clippy rustfmt rustsym
```

Now finally, for the VSCode itself, press `cmd-p` and `ext install vscode-rust`. I'm using the new `Rust` extension as `Rusty Code` has been discontinued.

If you're lucky - that's it, you should have working completion and highlighting in Rust files.
If not and you're greeted by this message: `You have chosen RLS mode but neither RLS executable path is specified nor rustup is installed` - we need to get the extension to get to know your setup a bit:

In VSCode go to `Settings` using `cmd-,` and put the following config elements there:

```
{
    "rust.cargoPath": "/Users/yourusername/.cargo/bin/cargo",
    "rust.cargoHomePath": "/Users/yourusername/.cargo",
    "rust.rustfmtPath": "/Users/yourusername/.cargo/bin/rustfmt",
    "rust.rustsymPath": "/Users/yourusername/.cargo/bin/rustsym",
    "rust.rustLangSrcPath": "/Users/yourusername/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/src/rust/src",
    "rust.mode": "rls",
    "rust.rls": {
        "executable": "/Users/yourusername/.cargo/bin/rls",
        "useRustfmt": true
    }
}
```
As the paths in the config need to be absolute, remember to adjust to your situation (system username) accordingly.

Now when you reload and start editing a Rust file you should see `RLS: Analysis finished` on the bottom bar and the completion and highlighting should all work. Yay !

Any questions ? Ask on [https://users.rust-lang.org/](https://users.rust-lang.org/) and ping me the link to the post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cyplo) or email it to me at [cyryl@codurance.com](mailto:cyryl@codurance.com). This way the answer will be visible to everyone in the community.

Keep on Rusting !
