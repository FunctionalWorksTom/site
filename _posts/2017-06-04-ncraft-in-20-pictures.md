NCrafts 2017 is a two days conference in Paris. I had the chance to also attend an event storming workshop run by Alberto Bbrandolini a day before the conference.
It was full of fun, socialising and learning.

Here are some of the things I learned during those three days of awesomeness:

About event storming and that I admire Brandolini.

{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/ncraft-buffet.jpg "" %}
Good food always makes for a good conference (you guessed I'm french here).


{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/customised-keyboard.jpg "" %}
Developers are fun and keyboards are a good way to socialise.

Big data can be so big you DDOS yourself.


{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/mob-testing-live-demo.png "" %}
Mobbing is not just for devs.


{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/webber-on-communities-of-practice.jpg "" %}
Community of practices are efficient ways to break team silo.

XP to the extreme works.


{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/ncraft-beer.jpg "" %}
Craft beer is a must have, looking forward to the veggie smoothie trend.

Becoming TEAL overnight might not be a good idea, I feel lucky to be part of a TEAL aspiring company.

The best talks are the one full of courage to face one's vulnerabilities.


{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/168-hour-week.png "" %}
Coding among the chickens sounds like something I would enjoy doing.


{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/ncraft-open-space.jpg "" %}
Open spaces in conferences is a surprisingly pleasant alternative, especially when being reminded that the talks will be recorded (FOMO contained).


{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/the-dev-awakening.jpg "" %}
We as developers have duty to not harm and inform non tech savvy.


{% img /assets/img/custom/blog/ncraft-2017/craftsmanship-father-to-son.jpg "" %}
I completely buy in the metaphore of devs as an artisanal trade and the comparison with masonry.

<br/>Diversity in speakers makes tech conferences much more interesting. 
But diversity in attendees is lacking and a sad reflection of our industry.

Software development is a life of learning and that's why we chose to code.
