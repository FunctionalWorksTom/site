                  <p>We are a company formed by craftswomen and craftsmen who care about the quality of the work we do.</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>What is important to us?</strong> We are looking for talented people who share our passion for writing well-crafted software and believe in the principles and values of Software Craftmanship, Exreme Programming and Agile software development. In addition, good communication skills, willingness to learn and work with different technology stacks, and confidence to express ideas are important.</p> 

                  <p><strong>What background do I need to have?</strong> You are a practitioner of Agile/Lean processes and Extreme Programming Practices, specifically TDD, CI, and Simple Design. Your prefer a DevOps culture and value Continuous Deployment/Delivery. You have appreciation for Software Design both at macro and micro levels and naturally follow Clean Code principles.

                  <p><strong>What technolgies do we use?</strong> Currently, the three main technology platforms we use are <strong>JVM (Java, Clojure, Scala), .Net (C#, F#), and NodeJS</strong>.

                  <p>Our apprentices share our passion for creating well-crafted software, but have not yet had the suitable learning opportunities to refine their craft.</p>

                  <p><strong>How does it work?</strong> The priority is for you to acquire the basic set of skills necessary to become recognised, as software craftsman, by the rest of the company. You will choose a mentor from our craftsmen who will help understand your strengths and weaknesses based on the core set. The mentor will guide you through your apprenticeship which we expect to be a maximum of 6 months. There is no exam in the end - when your mentor is convinced and can convince at least 3 other craftsmen then you graduate.</p>
                  <p><strong>What background do I need to have?</strong> You are a productive developer in the language of your choice on the JVM, .NET, and/or Node JS platforms. You know of Agile processes and practices and can apply them and are looking to become an expert in reasoning about them. You have basic knowledge of micro level and macro level design. </p>
                  <p><strong>Is this the programme for me?</strong> If you have a passion for learning and are ready for a chance to learn technologies and practices needed to become a Software Craftsman under the guidance of a dedicated mentor then we look forward to receiving your application.</p>
